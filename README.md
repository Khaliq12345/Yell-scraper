This project is a web scraping application built using Python's BeautifulSoup library. 
The application is designed to scrape business information from the Yellow Pages website. 
The extracted data is then stored in a CSV file or any other format that you have chosen.

The script is able to navigate through the Yellow Pages website, find the businesses you want to scrape and extract their information such as the business name, address, phone number, and website. The BeautifulSoup library allows for easy parsing and manipulation of the HTML data, making it simple to extract the specific information you need. The script also include error handling and retry mechanism in case of network failure or website blocking.

The project also includes a requirements.txt file that contains the necessary dependencies, and a brief instruction on how to run the script in your local machine.

Feel free to use the code as a reference for your own web scraping projects, and to make any changes as you see fit.
